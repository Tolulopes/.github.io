									<p>This was my final project where I deicded to create a Holiday Transfer site which is essentially a market place for people sell their entire holiday package, so this includes flights, hotels, and any pre-booked attractions.

									<p>This App is for clients to sign up and register and search for different classes that are held. Instructors are able to accept or reject requests, and once clients have attended the class they are able to leave comments on the class/instructor. This was built in rails using javascript, jquery, devise, and ransack.</p>

										<h3>HighclassHooliganHipster</h3>
									</header>
									<p>This was a 24hour hackathan where myself and one other student built a really fun app based on three London Sub-cultures Highclass, Hooligan, and Hipster which would create an Intenerary for a three day stay in London. The twist was that the itineraries linked to each sub-cultures would be mixed up so you would have a hipster attending a highclass event and so on.</p>
